Release Note
------------
 Version 1.0  Feb. 26, 2016
 Version 1.1  Mar. xx, 2016

------------
Requirements
------------
* Standard C compiler (e.g., GCC)
* Python2 (2.6 and higher; Python3 is not supported)
* Sufficient computing power
 Note1: Standard unix system including Linux and Mac OSX is recommended. There has been reported that this code does not work properly on a Linux system mounted on a Windows drive. This codes are tested under Mac OSX 10.9.5 on 2.8GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon machine and Fedora Core 20 on Intel Core i5-4690 3.50GHz machine. 
 Note2: Depending on the machine power, it takes <<several minutes>> if you run all the standard process. We recommend sufficient computing power at least similar to that we have tested. With our testing machine above, it takes about ~450 sec. (~200 sec. for noise calculation, ~155 sec. for emission line S/N calculation, and ~95 sec. for continuum S/N calculation).

<<Optional>>
* numpy (1.8 and higher)  see http://www.numpy.org
* pyfits (3.3 and higher) see http://www.stsci.edu/institute/software_hardware/pyfits
 Note: These two python modules are required for using gen_sim_spec.py. If you don't have these modules, please install them from the above website.

-----------
Description
-----------
All parameters can be specified in a .param file or passed as arguments. Here are a list and the description of parameters that users can manage.

1. Setup of the observation condition 
In this section, users can manage the observational conditions including seeing, zenith angle, galactic extinction, lunar condition, exposure time, and distance from FoV center.

For instance, if you want observational condition under 0.80 arcsec seeing, the target zenith angle of 45 deg., galactic extinction of 0.05 mag., new moon with a zenith angle of 30 deg. and target - moon separation of 60 deg., 8 exposures with a single exposure of 450 sec. (3600 sec in total), and observation at the edge of the FoV, the parameters in .param file should be as follows: 

SEEING           0.80               #  Seeing FWHM size             [arcsec]
ZENITH_ANG       45.00              #  Zenith angle                 [deg.]
GALACTIC_EXT     0.00               #  Galactic extinction          [ABmag.]
MOON_ZENITH_ANG  30.0               #  Moon zenith angle            [deg.]
MOON_TARGET_ANG  60.0               #  Moon-target separation       [deg.]
MOON_PHASE       0                  #  Moon phase                   [0=New,0.25=quarter,0.5=full]
EXP_TIME         450                #  Single exposure time         [sec.]
EXP_NUM          8                  #  The number of exposures
FIELD_ANG        0.675              #  Field angle                  [deg.; center=0, edge=0.675]

2. Setup of the target information
In this section, users can describe the target information including target magnitude, effective radius, emission line flux and width. If you want to calculate the S/N for a flat continuum with 22.5 ABmag and an emission line with line flux of 1.0x10^-17 erg/s/cm^2, line width of sigma=70 km/s, and effective radius of 0.3 arcsec, the parameters are as follows:

MAG_FILE         22.5               #  Magnitude or input spectrum  [ABmag] or <filename> 
REFF             0.3                #  Effective radius             [arcsec]
LINE_FLUX        1.0e-17            #  Emission line flux           [erg/s/cm^2]
LINE_WIDTH       70                 #  Emission line width sigma    [km/s]

Note: You can input your own target spectra into the ETC. Just specify the file name for the MAG_FILE parameter. The file should include wavelength [nm] and magnitude [ABmag] in the first and second column, respectively. Please note that the wavelength sampling should be larger than the pixel sampling of the PFS detector (~0.7A, ~0.8A, and ~0.8A for blue, red, and NIR arm, respectively).

3. Setup of the name of the output file
The outputs of the results for noise calculation (OUTFILE_NOISE), S/N for continuum (OUTFILE_SNC), S/N for line flux (OUTFILE_SNL) are saved to the files defined by users. If you want to measure the S/N for [OII] doublet, kindly use OUTFILE_OII parameter for the output file. If you set NOISE_REUSED to Y, the ETC will skip the process of generating noise vector which is a time-consuming process. The process time of the ETC can be reduced to roughly half by this mode. This mode is useful if you want to calculate the S/N of objects with various magnitudes and line fluxes with the same noise assumption (zenith angle, field angle, lunar condition, and exposure time). If you use this mode, you need to specified the noise vector file that you want to use in OUTFILE_NOISE parameter. Also, You can skip outputting the results of continuum S/N and emission line S/N by replace the name to '-'. If you want to use medium resolution mode in the red arm, set MR_MODE to Y.

NOISE_REUSED     N                  #  Noise Vector Reused?               [Y/N] (If Y, please specify file name used in OUTFILE_NOISE)
OUTFILE_NOISE    out/ref.noise.dat  #  Output file for noise vector       <filename>
OUTFILE_SNC      out/ref.snc.dat    #  Output file for continuum S/N      <filename>
OUTFILE_SNL      out/ref.snl.dat    #  Output file for emission line S/N  <filename>
OUTFILE_OII      -                  #  Output file for [OII] doublet S/N  <filename>
MR_MODE          N                  #  Medium resolution mode switch      [Y/N]
OVERWRITE        Y                  #  Overwrite switch                   [Y/N]

 (1) the spectrograph arm number
 (2) the pixel number
 (3) the vacuum wavelength in [nm]

--------------------------------------
Simulated spectrum (under development)
--------------------------------------
(N.b. you will need the python module numpy to run the simulator.  To write FITS files you'll also
need pyfits, and to use the plotting options you'll need matplotlib)


We can generate simulated outputs for use by the 1-D pipeline using a subset of the outputs from Chris
Hirata's simulator and then running gen_sim_spec.py.  The only output that we use is "OUTFILE_SNC",
and we only use a subset of the informatin in that file.  In particular, we the settings
    --EXP_NUM  (the number of exposures)
    --MAG_FILE (the input spectrum)
have *no* effect upon the simulator!

One parameters that does matter is
    --MR_MODE  (use low/medium resolution grating in the R arm)
and of course things to do with observing such as the exposure time, seeing, moon, ...
    --EXP_TIME
    --SEEING
    --MOON_PHASE ...
The settings used when running run_etc.py are the ones that will be used to generate an output spectrum. There
is a default value (N, i.e. the low resolution grating), but we'll be explicit when preparing files for the
simulator.

So, before running gen_sim_spec.py, you need to prepare input files with commands like:

   python run_etc.py default.param --MR_MODE no  --EXP_TIME 450 --OUTFILE_SNC etc-t450-lr.dat
   python run_etc.py default.param --MR_MODE yes --EXP_TIME 450 --OUTFILE_SNC etc-t450-mr.dat

These do more work than you actually need (e.g. calculating propertied of ELGs), and write output files
that you don't care about, but you can clean up by saying:
   rm -rf ./out

You are now ready to generate simulated spectra.  The input spectrum is given by the MAG_FILE parameter and
may be either a file (with columns of wavelength and AB magnitude) or a floating point number (the AB
magnitude of a flat-spectrum source).  The simulator will add appropriate noise, taking into account the
number of integrations requested.  Run the gen_sim_spec.py like this:

  python gen_sim_spec.py --etcFile etc-t450-lr.dat


You can either specify options on the command line (use --help to list them), or by providing a file
of overrides by adding e.g. "@sim_spec.defaults" to the command line (the @ means that this is an
input file).  The provided sim_spec.defaults has all its options commented out.  If you want to plot
the spectra, try --plotObject or --plotArm.

So a more complete example is:

   python gen_sim_spec.py @sim_spec.defaults --outDir out --etcFile ref.snc.dat \
   	  		  --ascii=out/test.sim.dat --writeFits False --MAG_FILE=20.0

to write the ascii file (out/test.sim.dat) instead of the fits files, simulating a 20th magnitude flat
spectrum source.  The noise is taken from the output of run_etc.py, used without specifying --OUTFILE_SNC
(which we do not recommend!)  Note that, as usual, arguments such as --asciiTable may be abbreviated.



1. The input file (e.g. sim_spec.defaults) has the same format as the input to the ETC, e.g.
etcFile       out/ref.snc.dat     #  Information about the noise per pixel; output of ETC
nrealize      1                   #  The number of realizations of the object
asciiTable    out/test.sim.dat    #  Output ASCII table

Here are some descriptions:

a. etcFile: Information about the background+instrumental noise per pixel; the ETC's --OUTFILE_SNC file

b. nrealize: The number of realizations of the noise, incrementing the objId for each

c. asciiTable: The file name of the output ASCII table of the simulated spectrum
The table includes the following items::

  (1)  WAVELENGTH  [nm]
  (2)  FLUX        [10^-17 erg/s/cm^2/A]
  (3)  ERROR       [10^-17 erg/s/cm^2/A]
  (4)  MASK        [1=masked]
  (5)  SKY         [10^-17 erg/s/cm^2/A]
  (6)  ARM         [0=blue,1=red,2=NIR,3=redMR]

The FITS format output will be automatically generated unless you specify "--writeFits False". The
filenames are defined by the datamodel, using values:
	  tract   0   	     		#  Tract
	  patch   0,0			#  Patch
	  visit   1			#  Visit number
	  objId   1			#  Object ID
	  catId   0			#  Catalogue ID

The format is defined by the datamodel, which may be found at
     https://github.com/Subaru-PFS/datamodel/blob/master/datamodel.txt

Note 1: The wavelength information on HDU #1,3,4,5,6 is described in the header by using CRPIX1, CRVAL1, and
CD1_1. The wavelength (lambda [nm]) corresponding to the pixel (X [pix]) is as follows:
       lambda = CRVAL1 + CD1_1*(X - CRPIX1)
Note that in these HDU are resampled from the original data so that the pixel scale is 0.8 A (TBD).

Note 2: Currently, the format of data table described above is still discussed in the DRP team and may be
changed in the future release.

Note 3: PFS configuration information, including catalogue ID, object ID, coordinate (dummy value is used),
fiber flux (flux density of the input magnitude), MPS centroid parameter (dummy value is used), will be saved
in "pfsConfig" file (e.g., "pfsConfig-0x00000001.fits").

Example (under development)
---------------------------
/////////////////////
/// Input spectra ///
/////////////////////

There are some examples of input spectra for the ETC. If you make additional example in your own calculation,
let the contact person described below know please.

1. An observation of a star-forming galaxy with a continuum and emission lines:

This example is a SDSS galaxy classified as GALAXY, whose spectra is redshifted to z=0.8 and scaled to mag=21
ABmag at 1000 nm. For this object with 1 hour exposure time under the seeing of 0.7 arcsec and gray
lunar-phase condition, assuming that the object in a fiber on the FoV center and the elevation angle is 60
deg., type the following command:

   python run_etc.py default.param --MAG_FILE=./example/spec/ex_gal_sf.dat --EXP_TIME=900 --EXP_NUM=4 --REFF=0.30 --OUTFILE_NOISE=./out/ex_gal_sf.noise.dat --OUTFILE_SNC=./out/ex_gal_sf.snc.dat --OUTFILE_SNL=- --NOISE_REUSED=N --MR_MODE=N --OVERWRITE=Y --SEEING=0.70 --ZENITH_ANG=30.0 --FIELD_ANG=0.00 --MOON_PHASE=0.25 --MOON_ZENITH_ANG=30.0 --MOON_TARGET_ANG=60.0

   python gen_sim_spec.py default.param --etcFile ./out/ex_gal_sf.snc.dat --asciiTable ./out/sim.ex_gal_sf.dat

2. An observation of a star-burst galaxy with (mostly) only emission lines:

This example is a SDSS galaxy classified as GALAXY STARBUSRT, whose spectra is redshifted to z=0.8 and scaled
to mag=26 ABmag at 1000 nm. For this object with 0.5 hour exposure time under the seeing of 0.5 arcsec and
bright lunar-phase condition, assuming that the object in a fiber on the FoV center and the elevation angle is
50 deg., type the following command:

   python run_etc.py default.param --MAG_FILE=./example/spec/ex_gal_sb.dat --EXP_TIME=900 --EXP_NUM=2 --REFF=0.30 --OUTFILE_NOISE=./out/ex_gal_sb.noise.dat --OUTFILE_SNC=./out/ex_gal_sb.snc.dat --OUTFILE_SNL=- --NOISE_REUSED=N --MR_MODE=N --OVERWRITE=Y --SEEING=0.50 --ZENITH_ANG=40.0 --FIELD_ANG=0.00 --MOON_PHASE=0.5 --MOON_ZENITH_ANG=30.0 --MOON_TARGET_ANG=60.0

   python gen_sim_spec.py default.param --etcFile ./out/ex_gal_sb.snc.dat --asciiTable ./out/sim.ex_gal_sb.dat

3. An observation of a passive galaxy with a continuum and absorption lines:

This example is generated by using a CB07 stellar population synthesis model with Chabrier IMF, solar
abundance, and single burst. The stellar age of the the galaxy is ~5 Gyr and with no dust extinction. The
intrinsic spectra is redshifted to z=1.2 and scaled to mag=21 ABmag at 1000 nm. For this object with 5 hour
exposure time under the seeing of 0.5 arcsec and bright lunar-phase condition, assuming that the object in a
fiber on the FoV center and the elevation angle is 60 deg., type the following command:

   python run_etc.py default.param --MAG_FILE=./example/spec/ex_gal_pv.dat --EXP_TIME=900 --EXP_NUM=20 --REFF=0.30 --OUTFILE_NOISE=./out/ex_gal_pv.noise.dat --OUTFILE_SNC=./out/ex_gal_pv.snc.dat --OUTFILE_SNL=- --NOISE_REUSED=N --MR_MODE=N --OVERWRITE=Y --SEEING=0.50 --ZENITH_ANG=30.0 --FIELD_ANG=0.00 --MOON_PHASE=0.5 --MOON_ZENITH_ANG=30.0 --MOON_TARGET_ANG=60.0

   python gen_sim_spec.py default.param --etcFile ./out/ex_gal_pv.snc.dat --asciiTable ./out/sim.ex_gal_pv.dat

///////////////////
/// Noise model ///
///////////////////

Because the calculation of noise models is very time consuming, we prepared some examples of noise model for
some cases. In ./example/noise/ directory, there are noise models varying zenith angle from 0 to 70 deg. and
field angle from 0.0 to 0.7 deg. for the dark moon phase and 8 exposures of 450 sec.  (e.g.,
ref.noise.drk.z30.f04.t450.dat).

-----------
Other notes
-----------

1. The other parameters that are implemented in the Chris Hirata's ETC are indicated in the run_etc.py
including instrument setups and sky subtraction floor. Users can change these parameters on your own
responsibility.

2. The fraction of light covered by fiber aperture may be overestimated by up to 10% depending on the field
angle compared to the ray-tracing calculation by using the PFS optical model including the telescope and the
wide-field corrector.

3. We assumed no fiber central position offset, additional 1% systematic sky subtraction error (on each 1D
pixel), and additional 2% diffuse stray light (the entire 2D detector surface) for the noise model
calculation.

4. As a fiducial sky continuum model, we use the recent sky model provided by Jim Gunn, which is basically in
consistent with the observations in the SDSS/BOSS in optical and the result obtained the MOSFIRE engineering
runs. We use the sky emission line model taken from UVES visible line atlas and theoretical model (Rousselot
et al. 2000, A&A, 354, 1134) in NIR. As a fiducial atmospheric transmission model, we use Kitt Peak model for
<900nm and a simulated ATRAN model with 3 mm PWV at longer wavelengths.

5. The original code (gsetc.c) provided by Chris Hirata, which is partially modified by people in Kavli IPMU,
can be found in the src directory. The manual for the code (Manual_v5.pdf) may be useful for understanding
some assumptions in the noise calculation.
